# CucumberTest

The exercise is to develop a mobile application consisting of two or more screens that perform the following functions, also main focuses on how to architect/configure a multi-module application.

1.	Capture a person’s name and a number.
2.	Convert this number into words with a currency of dollars and cents.
3.	Render this name and number (as words) on a new screen. 

It shows how to split an app in logical vertical slices, how to handle in-feature and across feature navigation (using navigation components), how each module can be tested and how to organize dependencies and build.gradle files.

Note that all code runs and executes, but the screens only contain data in xml preview. This means running the app provides a very "empty experience", but it also keeps the example simple and focused.
